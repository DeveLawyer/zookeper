# Zookeper

This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

I worked on this project at JetBrains Academy and it helped me to understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops in Python.
